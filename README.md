**The Front Desk System at a Clinic is a full-stack web application that streamlines clinic operations for front desk staff. Built using Next.js for the frontend and NestJS for the backend, with Tailwind CSS for styling and MySQL as the database, it allows users to manage patient queues, schedule and update appointments, and maintain doctor profiles efficiently. Features include secure JWT-based authentication, real-time status updates, appointment tracking, doctor search and filtering by specialization or availability, and responsive UI. This project is ideal for clinics aiming to digitize and optimize their scheduling and administrative workflows.**
